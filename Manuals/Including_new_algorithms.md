# Including new algorithms in the application
In order to address the issues arising from the various formats of rule files generated by different algorithms and to facilitate the integration of new algorithms without significant code modifications, the Strategy pattern has been implemented. This pattern allows encapsulating various functionalities into separate classes, promoting flexibility, reusability, and easy runtime substitution of functionalities.

To include a new algorithm, the following steps are required:

1. Create a class with the algorithm's name that inherits from the `lecturaFicheroReglas` interface.
2. Redefine the `lecturaFichero` method to read the rule file according to its format.
3. Make modifications in the following files:

- `constantes.py`: Here, the algorithm should be classified into algorithms that require discretized data (ALGORITMOS_NO_CONTINUOS) and those that do not (ALGORITMOS_EVOLUTIVOS).
- `importar_info`:
  - In the `definirAlgoritmos` method: Create a dictionary of classes containing representations of the algorithms.
  - In the `leerFicheros` method: Call the `lecturaFichero` method of the specific algorithm indicated in the rule file.
